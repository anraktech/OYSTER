    question: "Do I need to be from an English-speaking country to work in UK healthcare?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. For enrollment in UK Healthcare programs, you must either be from an English-speaking nation OR pass an approved English language exam like OET or IELTS. The language exam score requirements vary slightly based on the specific position you're seeking."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between OET and IELTS for healthcare professionals?",
    answer: "OET is specifically designed for medical professionals and uses healthcare-related scenarios and vocabulary. IELTS is a general English proficiency test used worldwide. Both are accepted by UK healthcare regulatory bodies, so you can choose the one that best suits your preparation style."
  },
  {
    question: "When were OET scores officially recognised in the UK?",
    answer: "The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) officially recognised OET on November 1, 2017, and the General Medical Council (GMC) recognised it on February 6, 2018. This recognition applies to nurses and doctors educated and trained worldwide."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose between IELTS Academic and General Training?",
    answer: "Yes, both IELTS Academic and General Training are accepted for UK healthcare employment. However, IELTS Academic is often preferred as it's specifically designed for academic and professional contexts."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't meet the exact score requirements?",
    answer: "Language requirements are set by regulatory bodies and employers for patient safety. If you don't meet the requirements initially, we can guide you to IELTS and OET preparation courses through our partner providers to help you achieve the necessary scores."
  },
  {
    question: "How long are my OET/IELTS scores valid?",
    answer: "Both OET and IELTS scores are typically valid for 2 years from the test date. However, some employers or regulatory bodies may have specific validity requirements, so it's best to check with the relevant authority."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide reimbursement for exam fees?",
    answer: "We could offer reimbursement for IELTS/OET exam fees and NMC registration fees (including CBT & OSCE) after placement for qualifying candidates. This is part of our comprehensive support package for healthcare professionals."

                      Grade B is the most commonly required Grade by regulatory bodies such as NMC and GMC in the UK. This is advanced level, equivalent to C1 in the Common European Framework or 7 in the Academic IELTS test. It is attainable but requires training on language skills and test techniques. Achieving Grade B strongly suggests that a medical/nursing professional has the right language skills to function safely and effectively in an English-speaking environment.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
                      The ORE is essential for dentists whose qualifications are not automatically recognised by the General Dental Council (GDC). Passing the exam allows them to apply for full registration and practise dentistry legally in the UK. It is designed to confirm that overseas dentists have the same level of knowledge, skills, and competence as graduates from UK dental schools.
